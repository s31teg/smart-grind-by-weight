# Hardware and Installation

Use this guide to collect the parts, print the mounts, wire the low-voltage
components and physically install Smart Grind. Start at the
[documentation home](DOC.md) if you have not yet identified the display
generation or confirmed grinder compatibility.

> [!CAUTION]
> Disconnect the grinder from mains before opening it. Preserve protective
> earth and insulation, and use a qualified person for mains work if needed.
> Bench-test the controller, HX711 and load cell using USB power before the
> motor-control lead is connected.

### 3D Printed Parts

All parts designed to print **without supports**. Keep the orientation of the STL files. Some holes are covered with thin plastic layers that you can easily remove.

**Print Settings:**
- **Material**: PETG (preferred) - Flexible enough for snap fits to work properly
- **Layer Height**: 0.2mm
- **Alternative**: PLA might work but will offer a reduced experience due to brittleness

## Installation and wiring

**V1 hardware** (original CO5300 display):

[<img src="../media/wiring_diagram_v1.png" alt="Wiring diagram for V1 hardware" width="50%">](../media/wiring_diagram_v1.png)

**V2 hardware** (newer SH8601 display, may be marked Rev1.1):

[<img src="../media/wiring_diagram_v2.png" alt="Wiring diagram for V2 hardware" width="50%">](../media/wiring_diagram_v2.png)

Both diagrams show 5V in red and ground in black whatever colours your grinder harness uses, and draw the HX711 pins in a tidy order rather than their physical order. Match connections by label and plug position, not by colour or position. Editable sources are in `../media/wiring_diagram_v1.svg` and `../media/wiring_diagram_v2.svg`; the original photo-style diagram is still available as [`wiring_diagram.png`](../media/wiring_diagram.png).

### Pin Configuration

**HX711 Load Cell Amplifier Connections:**
```
ESP32-S3 GPIO 2 (V1) / GPIO 1 (V2) → HX711 SCK
ESP32-S3 GPIO 3    →    HX711 DOUT
ESP32-S3 3.3V      →    HX711 VCC
ESP32-S3 GND       →    HX711 GND
```

**Load Cell to HX711 Wiring:**
```
Load Cell           HX711
Red (E+)         →  E+
Black (E-)       →  E-
White (A-)       →  A-
Green (A+)       →  A+
Yellow (Shield)  →  GND
```

- Connect the load cell shield wire (usually yellow) to the HX711 GND
- The HX711 only has 1 GND pin - solder the shield wire to the backside of the pin header
- **Tip**: Keep the load cell wire as short as possible to reduce noise

### Recommended Wire Lengths

Advised lengths:
- **Load cell → HX711:** ~10 cm
- **Eureka → Waveshare board:** ~15 cm (image shows a slightly shorter lead; 15 cm gives comfortable slack)
- **Grinder harness → HX711:** ~30 cm to route from the housing feed-through to the amplifier without strain

These lengths fit the Eureka Mignon layout shown here; other grinders may require different cable lengths.

**Eureka Mignon Connections:**

⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNING:** Always verify your specific Eureka's wiring independently! Wire colors vary between units and cannot be trusted. Use the numbered pin positions shown in the reference image.

Using the 4-pin Eureka plug pinout (see `../media/4-pin_Eureka_plug_pinout.png`), counting from left to right with the plug oriented with 'ribs' towards you:

[<img src="../media/4-pin_Eureka_plug_pinout.png" alt="4-Pin Eureka Plug Pinout" width="50%">](../media/4-pin_Eureka_plug_pinout.png)

```
ESP32-S3 5V        →    Pin 1 (5V power)
                        Pin 2 (Button signal - not used in this project)
ESP32-S3 GPIO 18 (V1) / GPIO 16 (V2) → Pin 3 (Motor control signal)
ESP32-S3 GND       →    Pin 4 (Ground)
```

**4-Pin Eureka Plug Reference (Left to Right):**
- **Pin 1**: 5V power supply
- **Pin 2**: Button signal (unused in this project)
- **Pin 3**: Motor control signal *(active-high — the motor runs when the revision-specific GPIO drives this pin to ~3.3V)*
- **Pin 4**: Ground

> [!WARNING]
> On V2, do not connect motor control to GPIO 18. It is shared with the touchscreen interrupt (`TP_INT`) and its pull-up circuitry can leak voltage into the grinder control input. The physically verified V2 wiring uses GPIO 16 for motor control and GPIO 1 for HX711 SCK.

⚠️ **VERIFY 5V:** Use a multimeter to confirm the 5V pin and identify the motor lead by plug position, not colour. In the verified V2 Specialita installation, Pin 3 (motor control) was the **grey** wire and Pin 2 (unused button signal) was **white**; an earlier assumption had these reversed. Wire colours can differ between grinder revisions, so treat this only as a checked example and leave Pin 2 disconnected and insulated.

### Installation Steps

1. **Flash the firmware** on the Waveshare board using the
   [firmware and first-setup guide](FIRMWARE_SETUP.md)
2. **Add the 1000μF capacitor** between 5V and ground (protects against brownouts)
3. **Create HX711 to Waveshare connection:**
   - Add angled pin headers to HX711 (VCC, GND, DOUT, SCK pins)
   - Connect dupont cables to Waveshare board
   - Load cell can be directly soldered to HX711 (Make the wires as short as possible. Connect shield wire as well to GND)
4. **For Eureka Mignon assembly:**
   - Disassemble top plate and front plate
   - Remove the button: unscrew from front plate, open grinder from below, unplug connector from powerboard, store plug+cable to revert mod later
   - Use JST-PH plug to connect to Waveshare board
   - **WARNING:** Wire colors vary significantly between Eureka units - always verify pin functions with a multimeter before connecting!
   - Mount Waveshare screen using 3D printed adapter where original screen was (the Waveshare screen with adapter replaces the original screen and reuses the original mounting screws)
   - Fish HX711 wire through housing, exit via button hole
   - Mount load cell and HX711 to 3D printed back plate
   - Clip 3D printed back plate onto Eureka Mignon
   - Connect plug to HX711
   - Add 3D printed cover plate and screw down
   - Add 3D printed dosing cup holder on load cell and screw down
   - Hide screws with 3D printed screw covers
5. **Calibrate the load cell** using the
   [firmware and first-setup guide](FIRMWARE_SETUP.md#initial-calibration).
